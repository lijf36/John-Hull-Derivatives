# chapter 1 Introduction

1.1. What is the difference between a long forward position and a short forward position? 

A long position agrees to buy the underlying asset on a certain specified future date for a certain specified price.

A short forward position agrees to sell the underlying asset on the same date for the same price.

1.2. Explain carefully the difference between hedging, speculation, and arbitrage. 

Hedging is using derivatives to reduce the risk that they face from potential future movements in a market variable. 

Speculation is using them to bet on the future direction of market variable.

Arbitrage is taking offsetting position in two or more instruments to lock in a profit.



1.3. What is the difference between entering into a long forward contract when the forward price is \$50 and taking a long position in a call option with a strike price of \$50? 

Long forward contract: In a long forward contract, the investor agrees to buy an underlying asset at a predetermined price on a specified date in the future. Forward contracts are private agreements between two parties and are not standardized or traded on exchange.

Long call option: A call is a financial contract the gives the investor the right, but not the obligation, to buy an underlying asset at a predetermined price on a specific date. Options are usually standardized contracts and are often traded on exchanges.



Potential payoffs:

Long forward contract: The payoff is linear and depends on the difference between the forward price and market price of the underlying asset at the expiration date. If the market price is higher than the forward price, the buyer will profit, otherwise, the buyer will incur a loss.

Long call option: The payoff is nonlinear. The profit potential is unlimited if the market price of the underlying asset rises above the strike price, as the buyer can exercise the option and purchase the asset at lower price than the market. However, if the market price is below the strike price, the buyer can choose not to exercise the option, limiting their loss to the option premium.







1.4. Explain carefully the difference between selling a call option and buying a put option. 1.5. An investor enters into a short forward contract to sell 100,000 British pounds for U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of 1.5000 USD per pound. How much does the investor gain or lose if the exchange rate at the end of the contract is (a) 1.4900 and (b) 1.5200? 1.6. A trader enters into a short cotton futures contract when the futures price is 50 cents per pound. The contract is for the delivery of 50,000 pounds. How much does the trader gain or lose if the cotton price at the end of the contract is (a) 48.20 cents per pound and (b) 51.30 cents per pound?
